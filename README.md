# EVENTLY
Evently is a app to help people connect to others in their neighborhoods. As someone who moved to a new city
from a small town it can be difficult to find things to do with people around my age. This app is meant to help
address this issue by being a one stop shop for community events small and large.

# Event-UI
This is the frontend repository that users will interact with to create new events and of course see other peoples
events that they may want to attend.
